City at Dawn

Chapter 1

Lights softened along the avenue as dawn pressed a pale hand against the windows. The city, still half-asleep, turned in its bed and listened to the trolley ring in the distance.

There was a warmth to the quietâ€”the kind that let thoughts rise slowly, like steam from the first cup of coffee. Somewhere on Third Street, a baker opened the door and the smell of bread found its way into dreams.

Chapter 2

Old newspapers remembered yesterday's storms, folded neatly beside a door painted sky-blue. A cat watched from the sill, narrowing its eyes when the pigeons rehearsed their morning ballet.

On the corner, a traveler checked a map twice, then smiled as if the streets themselves had confided the secret of arrival.

Chapter 3

The park wore dew like a necklace, and the benches held stories in their wood. An artist unfolded an easel and drew the quiet curve of a path that seemed to wander toward kindness.

A child counted clouds, insisting that each one knew a different song.

Chapter 4

As the sun climbed, windows became small theaters, each with its own play. A seamstress guided thread through a labyrinth of fabric; a teacher sharpened chalk and thought about the weight of a question.

Chapter 5

By noon, the city remembered its name. Voices gathered in the square, not loud but sure, as if the day had finally chosen its tempo. Somewhere, a letter was delivered, and the words inside fit perfectly, like shoes on a familiar road.
